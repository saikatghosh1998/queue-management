# QR Code based Queue Management System
Queue Management System is defined as a set of principles aimed at controlling customer flow and streamlining the queuing experience. 
It helps us to manage a large crowd in a systematic way where no human interface is needed for normal functioning. Our Queue Management System helps the user to scan a QR code which redirects it to a web portal where the user enters the basic information, including purpose of visit and phone number and generates a token number.
